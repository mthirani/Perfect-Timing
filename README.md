# Perfect-Timing
Two web-based stopwatches (one counting up and the other counting down)

A small set of stop watches in a single web page to play around with, contains the below requirement:
1.    1 input field: in which the user can specify how many seconds to count up to / down from. (We'll call this the countTarget.)
2.    2 read-only stopwatch displays: one counting up from 0 to countTarget, and the other counting down from countTarget to 0.
3.    2 sets of stopwatch controls: one set of controls (start/pause button and reset button) for each stopwatch.
